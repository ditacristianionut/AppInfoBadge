```
``` kotlin
dependencies { 
  implementation 'com.github.ditacristianionut:AppInfoBadge:$version'
}
```

## How to use
Use AppInfoBadge to create an instance of AppInfoBadgeFragment configured as you wish:
``` kotlin
 val aboutPage = AppInfoBadge  
  .darkMode { true }  
  .headerColor { Color.RED }  
  .withAppIcon { true }  
  .withPermissions { true }  
  .withChangelog { true }  
  .withLicense { true }  
  .withLibraries { true }
  .withRater { true }  
  .withEmail { "developer@gmail.com" }  
  .withSite { "https://www.developer.com" }
  .withCustomItems { listOf<BaseInfoItem>() }
  .show()
```

#### Custom items
Apart from the predefined items, you can inject your own list of items.
There are two types of items:

 - **InfoItemWithView** - when selected, a bottom sheet dialog with your own defined content is displayed
 - **InfoItemWithLink** - when selected, a link defined by you is opened

**InfoItemWithView** fields:
 - ```iconId: Int``` - a drawable resource that is used on the main page and inside the bottom sheet dialog (header icon)
 - ```title: String``` - the name of the item used on the main page 
 - ```headerColor: Int```: - background color of the header
 - ```res: Int?``` - a layout resouce that will be displayed on the bottom sheet dialog
 - ```view: View?``` - a view that will be displayed on the bottom sheet dialog 	You can only use one of the *two*: res or *view*!

**InfoItemWithLink** fields:
 - ```iconId: Int``` - a drawable resource that is used on the main page and inside the bottom sheet dialog (header icon)
 - ```title: String``` - the name of the item used on the main page 
 - ```headerColor: Int```: - background color of the header
 - ```link: Uri``` - the URI of the resource that will be open on item click
##### Samples:
``` kotlin
val itemWithView = InfoItemWithView(  
	 iconId = R.drawable.ic_test,  
	 title = "First custom item with view",  
	 headerColor = R.color.deep_purple_600,  
     res = null,  
     view = ImageView(this).also {  
	     it.setImageResource(R.drawable.ic_link) 
	  }  
)  
  
val itemWithRes = InfoItemWithView(  
 iconId = R.drawable.ic_test,  
   title = "Second custom item with view",  
   headerColor = R.color.indigo_600,  
   res = R.layout.test_item,
